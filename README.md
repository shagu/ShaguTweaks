# ShaguTweaks

<img src="screenshots/menu.jpg" float="right" align="right">

> **A small World of Warcraft (1.12.1 / 2.4.3) AddOn for those, who don't want to use any AddOns at all.**

The goal of ShaguTweaks is to be non-intrusive to the default appearance, but also giving the user the choice to change additional settings if desired. The pre-selected defaults of ShaguTweaks only add those quality of life changes to the game, that are preserving the look and feel of the original interface. It's up to everyones own preferences to enable more or even disable some more.

All tweaks are made to the default interface and might not take effect if you already replaced some of the elements with other addons.

All addon settings can be controlled in game via the "Advanced Options" button on the Main Menu (*Esc*).
Every of the listed features below, can be completely disabled in that menu in case you don't like it.

**Notice:**
*This Addon or a superior and maintained version of it, is already included in [pfUI](https://github.com/shagu.pfUI). If using this in combination with pfUI you might get bad results or up to performance regressions.*
